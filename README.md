## Samples of past projects and presentations

These 4 folders each contain a PDF of a PowerPoint presentation I created on a variety topics, as well as some code that respesents that project or topic. 

The SQL-PL presentation focuses on creating and using IBM DB2 for i stored procedures and user defined functions. The others are case studies of projects I created for a few of my clients from when I was self employed. The PDFs provide details of what each project is all about. 

I will go over these briefly on Friday. If you have time before then, please do check out the PDFs and some of the source code. 

Please bear in mind, I am not a designer, so the UI may seem rough on some of the screen shots. The only one in this collection that was public-facing is PolarLink, for which I had designers involved. The others are internal use only, for companies that primarily use legacy, green-screen ERP systems. These were all very successful projects that my clients love (just sayin'). 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

John
