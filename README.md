## Samples of past projects and presentations

These 4 folders each contain a PDF of a PowerPoint presentation I created on a variety topics, as well as some code that respesents that project or topic. 

The SQL-PL presentation focuses on creating and using IBM DB2 for i stored procedures and user defined functions. The others are case studies of projects I created for a few of my clients from when I was self employed. The PDFs provide details of what each project is all about. 

I will go over these briefly on Friday. If you have time before then, please do check out the PDFs and some of the source code. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
