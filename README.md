## Samples of past projects and presentations

These 4 folders each contain a PDF of a PowerPoint presentation I created on a variety topics, as well as some code that respesents that project or topic. 

The SQL-PL presentation focuses on creating and using IBM DB2 for i stored procedures and user defined functions. The other are case-studies of project I created for a few of my clients from when I was self employed. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
